# Gemini's Action Plan and Progress

## Current Status:
All planned refactoring steps have been completed.

## Analysis Summary:
*   **State Management:** Mixed usage of `StatefulWidget`, `ChangeNotifierProvider`, and `ValueNotifier`. `provider` is already in use.
*   **Dependency Injection (Service Location):** Direct instantiation of services in some places, leading to tight coupling.
*   **Routing/Navigation:** Standard `Navigator` usage, which can become complex for advanced scenarios.
*   **Data Models & Serialization:** Manual `fromJson`/`toJson` methods.
*   **Database:** Direct `sqflite` usage with raw SQL.
*   **Animations:** Custom `AnimationController` implementations.
*   **Game Engines:** Appropriate use of `flame` for games.

## Step-by-step Plan:

1.  **Introduce `get_it` for Service Location (In Progress):**
    *   **Goal:** Decouple services from UI and improve testability.
    *   **Actions Taken:**
        *   Added `get_it` to `pubspec.yaml`.
        *   Ran `flutter pub get`.
        *   Created `lib/locator.dart` to register `GamificationService`, `SoundService`, and `DatabaseService`.
        *   Modified `main.dart` to initialize `get_it` and remove `MultiProvider` for services.
        *   Refactored `GameController` to use `getIt<GamificationService>()`.
        *   Refactored `WordSearchController` to use `getIt<GamificationService>()`.
        *   Refactored `ProfileScreen` to use `getIt<GamificationService>()` and `getIt<SoundService>()`.
        *   Refactored `CollectibleCardDetailPage` to use `getIt<SoundService>()`.
        *   Refactored `QixGameScreen` to use `getIt<GamificationService>()`.
        *   Refactored `SnakeGame` to use `getIt<GamificationService>()`.
        *   Refactored `PuzzleFlameGame` to use `getIt<GamificationService>()`.

2.  **Fix Analysis Issues (Completed):**
    *   **Goal:** Resolve all errors, warnings, and info messages from `flutter analyze`.
    *   **Actions Taken:**
        *   `directive_after_declaration` in `main.dart`, `word_search_controller.dart`, `profile_screen.dart` fixed.
        *   `Undefined class 'GamificationService'` in `word_search_controller.dart` fixed.
        *   `Undefined name 'context'` in `qix/main.dart` (by adding `BuildContext context` parameter) fixed.
        *   Structural issues in `qix/main.dart` (fields and methods outside class) fixed.
        *   `error • The method 'getIt' isn't defined for the type '_SnakeGameState'` in `lib/screens/games/snake/screen.dart` fixed.
        *   `error • The name 'DatabaseService' isn't a type, so it can't be used as a type argument` in `lib/screens/profile_screen.dart` fixed.
        *   `deprecated_member_use` in `lib/screens/collectible_card_detail_page.dart` fixed.
        *   `always_use_package_imports` in multiple files fixed.
        *   `withOpacity` deprecation in `lib/screens/games/order_the_scrolls/widgets/detail_panel.dart` fixed.
        *   `prefer_single_quotes` in multiple files fixed.
        *   `sort_child_properties_last` in `lib/screens/games/snake/screen.dart` fixed.
        *   `unused_import` and `duplicate_import` in `lib/screens/games/snake/snake_component.dart` and `lib/screens/games/word_search/word_search_screen.dart` fixed.
    *   **Current Errors to Fix:** None.
    *   **Current Warnings/Info to Fix:** None.

3.  **Refactor Animations with `flutter_animate` (Completed):**
    *   **Goal:** Replace custom `AnimationController` implementations with `flutter_animate` for simpler, more declarative animations.
    *   **Actions Taken:**
        *   Added `flutter_animate` to `pubspec.yaml`.
        *   Ran `flutter pub get`.
        *   Refactored `InteractiveCollectibleCard` to use `flutter_animate` for the shine effect.
        *   Refactored `GameOverPopup` to use `flutter_animate` for entry animations.
        *   Refactored `MinesweeperScreen` to use `flutter_animate` for cell animations.
4.  **Refactor Data Models with `freezed` and `json_serializable` (Completed)**
    *   **Actions Taken:**
        *   Added `freezed`, `freezed_annotation`, `json_serializable`, and `build_runner` to `pubspec.yaml`.
        *   Ran `flutter pub get`.
        *   Refactored `Answer` model to use `freezed` and `json_serializable`.
        *   Refactored `CollectibleCard` model to use `freezed` and `json_serializable`.
        *   Refactored `Question` model to use `freezed` and `json_serializable`.
        *   Refactored `MythCard` model to use `freezed` and `json_serializable`.
        *   Refactored `MythStory` model to use `freezed` and `json_serializable`.
        *   Ran `flutter pub run build_runner build` to generate the necessary files.**
5.  **Refactor Routing with `go_router` (Completed)**
    *   **Actions Taken:**
        *   Added `go_router` to `pubspec.yaml`.
        *   Ran `flutter pub get`.
        *   Created `lib/router.dart` to define `GoRouter` configuration.
        *   Modified `main.dart` to use `GoRouter`.
        *   Replaced all `Navigator.of(context).push` and `Navigator.of(context).pushNamedAndRemoveUntil` calls with `context.go()` or `context.push()`.**

## Next Steps:
I will now proceed with refactoring animations using `flutter_animate`.
