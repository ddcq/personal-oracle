  "collectible_card_baldr_title": "Baldr the Good",
  "collectible_card_baldr_description": "The god of light, beauty, and purity, son of Odin and Frigg. Beloved by all, his presence brought joy and peace. A prophetic dream of his own death prompted his mother, Frigg, to make everything in creation swear never to harm him. Only mistletoe, deemed too young and harmless, was overlooked. His tragic death, orchestrated by Loki, was the first and most terrible omen of the coming of Ragnar√∂k, the end of times.",
  "collectible_card_frigg_title": "Frigg the Mother",
  "collectible_card_frigg_description": "Goddess of love, marriage, and motherhood, wife of Odin and queen of Asgard. She is the mother of Baldr, the beloved god.

Her maternal love drove her to protect Baldr by making all creation swear an oath, a desperate attempt that was thwarted by Loki's cunning.",
  "collectible_card_gui_title": "The Deadly Mistletoe",
  "collectible_card_gui_description": "The only plant capable of harming the god Baldr. Frigg, in her quest to protect her son, had made every element of nature swear never to harm him. However, she overlooked mistletoe, considering it too young and weak to pose a threat. Loki, the god of mischief, exploited this flaw. He crafted an arrow from mistletoe and gave it to H√∂d, Baldr's blind brother, who killed him unintentionally.",
  "collectible_card_thor_title": "Thor the Protector",
  "collectible_card_thor_description": "The god of thunder, son of Odin and J√∂rd (the Earth). A devoted protector of Asgard and humans (Midgard), he is known for his prodigious strength and unwavering courage. Armed with his hammer Mj√∂llnir, which always returns to his hand, his belt Megingjord that multiplies his strength tenfold, and his iron gloves J√°rngreipr, he relentlessly fights giants and monsters that threaten cosmic order.",
  "collectible_card_mjollnir_title": "Mj√∂llnir",
  "collectible_card_mjollnir_description": "Thor's legendary hammer, forged by the dwarfs Brokkr and Sindri. A symbol of both protection and destruction, it can control lightning and thunder. Mj√∂llnir never misses its target and always returns to its bearer after being thrown. It is one of the most powerful weapons of the gods, indispensable in the eternal struggle against forces of chaos, especially giants.",
  "collectible_card_thrym_title": "Thrym the Giant",
  "collectible_card_thrym_description": "The formidable king of the frost giants (J√∂tun) who dared to steal Mj√∂llnir, Thor's hammer. In exchange for its return, he demanded the hand of the goddess Freyja. To retrieve his weapon, Thor disguised himself as Freyja, accompanied by Loki as a servant. The ruse worked, and once the hammer was in his possession, Thor slaughtered Thrym and his entire court, restoring the gods' honor.",
  "collectible_card_fenrir_title": "Fenrir the Wolf",
  "collectible_card_fenrir_description": "The gigantic wolf, one of the three monstrous children of Loki and the giantess Angrboda. The gods, frightened by his rapid growth and prophecies announcing he would cause their doom, decided to chain him. After breaking two chains, he was finally bound by the magical bond Gleipnir. During Ragnar√∂k, he will break free and fulfill his destiny by devouring Odin, before being killed by Vidar, Odin's son.",
  "collectible_card_tyr_title": "T√Ωr the Sacrificed",
  "collectible_card_tyr_description": "The god of war, law, and justice. Of exemplary courage, he is the only god who dared approach the wolf Fenrir when it became too large and threatening. To prove to the wolf that they didn't want to trap him with the magical chain Gleipnir, T√Ωr placed his right hand in the beast's mouth. When Fenrir realized he was chained, he tore off the hand. This sacrifice neutralized the wolf until Ragnar√∂k.",
  "collectible_card_gleipnir_title": "Gleipnir",
  "collectible_card_gleipnir_description": "The magical chain forged by the dwarfs to bind the wolf Fenrir. Unlike the heavy previous chains that Fenrir had broken, Gleipnir was as fine and supple as a silk ribbon. It was made from six impossible ingredients: the sound of a cat's footstep, a woman's beard, the roots of a mountain, a bear's sinews, a fish's breath, and a bird's saliva. It is the only bond that Fenrir could never break.",
  "collectible_card_ymir_title": "Ymir the Primordial Giant",
  "collectible_card_ymir_description": "The first living being, a primordial giant born from the meeting of fire from Muspelheim and ice from Niflheim in the void of Ginnungagap. From his sweat came the first giants. He was nourished by the cosmic cow Audhumla. Eventually, he was killed by the gods Odin and his brothers, Vili and V√©. From his body, they created the world: his flesh became the earth, his blood the oceans, his bones the mountains, and his skull the celestial vault.",
  "collectible_card_audhumla_title": "Audhumla the Cosmic Cow",
  "collectible_card_audhumla_description": "The primordial cow, born from melting ice at the beginning of time, just like the giant Ymir. From her udders flowed four rivers of milk that nourished Ymir and ensured his survival. By licking a salty block of ice, Audhumla revealed Buri, the first of the gods and Odin's ancestor. She is thus the origin of both lineages, that of giants and that of gods, who will clash during Ragnar√∂k.",
  "collectible_card_ginnungagap_title": "The Ginnungagap",
  "collectible_card_ginnungagap_description": "The gaping and silent void that existed before any creation. It was a bottomless abyss, bordered to the north by the icy realm of Niflheim and to the south by the fiery realm of Muspelheim. It was from the meeting between the icy breath of Niflheim and the burning sparks of Muspelheim at the center of Ginnungagap that life emerged, giving birth to the primordial giant Ymir and the cosmic cow Audhumla.",
  "collectible_card_brokkr_sindri_title": "Brokkr and Sindri",
  "collectible_card_brokkr_sindri_description": "Two dwarf brothers, master smiths renowned for their unmatched skill. Following a trick by Loki, they made a wager with the god that they could create more wonderful objects than those made by the sons of Ivaldi. They thus forged three exceptional treasures: the golden boar Gullinbursti for Freyr, the golden ring Draupnir for Odin, and the most famous of all, the hammer Mj√∂llnir for Thor, despite a minor flaw (its short handle) due to Loki's interference.",
  "collectible_card_draupnir_title": "Draupnir the Ring",
  "collectible_card_draupnir_description": "The magical ring of pure gold possessed by Odin, one of the greatest treasures of the gods. Forged by the dwarfs Brokkr and Sindri, its name means 'the dripper'. It has the extraordinary ability to multiply: every nine nights, it produces eight new gold rings of identical weight and quality. Draupnir was placed by Odin on his son Baldr's funeral pyre as a sign of respect, but was returned to him from the realm of the dead.",
  "collectible_card_gungnir_title": "Gungnir the Spear",
  "collectible_card_gungnir_description": "Odin's infallible spear, which never misses its target. Its name means 'the swaying one'. It was also forged by dwarfs, the sons of Ivaldi, and obtained by Loki. An oath carved on its tip guarantees its accuracy. Gungnir is a symbol of Odin's power and authority as god of war. It was by sacrificing himself, hanging from Yggdrasil and pierced by his own spear, that Odin acquired knowledge of the runes.",
  "collectible_card_hrimthurs_title": "Hrimthurs the Builder",
  "collectible_card_hrimthurs_description": "A giant (J√∂tunn) who presented himself to the gods as a simple builder. He proposed an audacious bargain: to build an impregnable fortress around Asgard in just three seasons. In payment, he demanded the goddess Freyja, as well as the Sun and Moon. The gods accepted, thinking the task impossible. But the giant, aided by his magical horse Svadilfari, progressed so quickly that the gods became frightened and asked Loki to intervene.",
  "collectible_card_svadilfari_title": "Svadilfari the Horse",
  "collectible_card_svadilfari_description": "The magical and exceptionally strong horse of the builder giant Hrimthurs. Its name means 'unlucky traveler'. Svadilfari's speed and power were such that it allowed its master to build Asgard's wall at prodigious speed, threatening to make the giant win the wager. To sabotage the work, Loki transformed into a beautiful mare and lured Svadilfari away from its master, thus preventing the wall's completion in time.",
  "collectible_card_sleipnir_title": "Sleipnir the Eight-Legged Horse",
  "collectible_card_sleipnir_description": "Odin's horse, born from the union of Loki transformed into a mare and Svadilfari. The fastest of all horses in the nine worlds, capable of galloping on land, sea, and air. Sleipnir is Odin's faithful steed, carrying him across worlds during his journeys. His eight legs symbolize his supernatural speed and his ability to move between dimensions.",
  "collectible_card_bifrost_title": "Bifrost",
  "collectible_card_bifrost_description": "The vibrant and shimmering rainbow bridge that connects Midgard, the world of men, to Asgard, the fortress of the gods. It is described as being made of fire, air, and water, and is stronger than any other structure. It is permanently guarded by the god Heimdall, who watches over its access from his guard post, Himinbj√∂rg. Bifrost will collapse during Ragnar√∂k under the weight of the fire giants led by Surt.",
  "collectible_card_bragi_title": "Bragi",
  "collectible_card_bragi_description": "The god of poetry, eloquence, and music. He is the husband of Idunn, keeper of the apples of youth. Bragi is depicted as a wise old man with a long beard, whose words are so beautiful they charm all who hear them. He is the skald (poet) of the gods' court in Asgard, welcoming valorous warriors arriving at Valhalla with his epic songs that recount their deeds and the glory of the gods.",
  "collectible_card_brisingamen_title": "Brisingamen",
  "collectible_card_brisingamen_description": "The magnificent and legendary necklace of the goddess Freyja. Its name means 'fire jewel'. It was forged by four expert dwarfs. To obtain it, Freyja had to spend one night with each of them. This necklace is the symbol of her beauty, seduction, and power over love and desire. It was stolen by Loki and recovered by Heimdall after a fierce battle where both took the form of seals.",
  "collectible_card_freyja_title": "Freyja",
  "collectible_card_freyja_description": "Major goddess of Norse mythology, associated with love, beauty, fertility, but also war, wealth, and magic (seidr). Twin sister of Freyr, she is the most beautiful of goddesses. She rules over her own realm, F√≥lkvangr, where she welcomes half the warriors who died heroically in battle, the other half going to Odin's Valhalla. She possesses the necklace Brisingamen and a chariot pulled by two cats.",
  "collectible_card_gjallarhorn_title": "Gjallarhorn",
  "collectible_card_gjallarhorn_description": "The 'Resounding Horn' of the god Heimdall. He uses it to watch over the Bifrost bridge. The sound of this horn is so powerful it can be heard in all nine worlds. Heimdall will sound the Gjallarhorn only once, but it will be for a momentous event: he will use it to alert all gods of the beginning of Ragnar√∂k, when giants and monsters launch their final assault against Asgard.",
  "collectible_card_heimdall_title": "Heimdall",
  "collectible_card_heimdall_description": "The vigilant guardian of Asgard, stationed at the entrance of the Bifrost bridge to prevent giants from invading the realm of the gods. Born of nine mothers, he possesses superhuman senses: his piercing sight allows him to see hundreds of leagues away and his hearing is so fine he can hear grass growing. He is the keeper of the horn Gjallarhorn. During Ragnar√∂k, he will be the last to fall, killing his eternal enemy Loki in a battle where they will kill each other.",
  "collectible_card_hel_title": "Hel",
  "collectible_card_hel_description": "Daughter of Loki and the giantess Angrboda, sister of the wolf Fenrir and the serpent J√∂rmungandr. Banished by Odin, she became the sovereign of the realm of the dead, Helheim. She is often depicted with a body half living and half decomposed. She rules over the souls of those who died of sickness or old age, as opposed to warriors who died in combat and go to Valhalla or F√≥lkvangr. Her power over the dead is absolute.",
  "collectible_card_helheim_title": "Helheim",
  "collectible_card_helheim_description": "The realm of the dead, one of the nine worlds, ruled by the goddess Hel. It is a dark, cold, and misty place, located in the depths of Niflheim. This is where the souls of those who did not die heroically in battle go. The entrance to Helheim is guarded by the monstrous dog Garm. Even the gods cannot escape without Hel's permission, as shown by the vain attempt to bring Baldr back to life.",
  "collectible_card_hofund_title": "Hofund",
  "collectible_card_hofund_description": "The gleaming sword of the guardian god Heimdall. Its name means 'man's head', possibly referring to a carved pommel. Like its owner, the sword is a symbol of vigilance and protection for Asgard. Though less famous than other divine weapons like Mj√∂llnir or Gungnir, Hofund is a powerful weapon that will be used by Heimdall in his final and mutually destructive battle against Loki during Ragnar√∂k.",
  "collectible_card_huginnmuninn_title": "Huginn and Muninn",
  "collectible_card_huginnmuninn_description": "The two ravens perched on Odin's shoulders. Their names mean 'Thought' (Huginn) and 'Memory' (Muninn). Each morning, Odin sends them to traverse the nine worlds. Upon their return, they whisper in his ear everything they have seen and heard. They are the All-Father's sources of information, granting him quasi-omniscient knowledge of past, present, and future events, and helping him in his insatiable quest for wisdom.",
  "collectible_card_idunn_title": "Idunn",
  "collectible_card_idunn_description": "Goddess of youth and eternity, wife of the poet god Bragi. She is the keeper of the golden apples, magical fruits that grant the gods their youth and immortality. Without these apples, the gods would age and die like mere mortals. Idunn was once kidnapped by the giant Thjazi with Loki's complicity, forcing the gods to age until Loki was compelled to bring her back to Asgard.",
  "collectible_card_jormungandr_title": "J√∂rmungandr",
  "collectible_card_jormungandr_description": "The Serpent of Midgard, one of the three children of Loki and the giantess Angrboda. Thrown into the ocean surrounding Midgard by Odin, it grew so enormously that it ended up encircling the world of men and biting its own tail, hence its nickname 'World-Serpent'.
