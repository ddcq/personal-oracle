  "collectible_card_baldr_title": "Baldr the Good",
  "collectible_card_baldr_description": "The god of light, beauty, and purity, son of Odin and Frigg. Beloved by all, his presence brought joy and peace. A prophetic dream of his own death prompted his mother, Frigg, to make everything in creation swear never to harm him. Only mistletoe, deemed too young and harmless, was overlooked. His tragic death, orchestrated by Loki, was the first and most terrible omen of the coming of Ragnar√∂k, the end of times.",
  "collectible_card_frigg_title": "Frigg the Mother",
  "collectible_card_frigg_description": "Goddess of love, marriage, and motherhood, wife of Odin and queen of Asgard. She is the mother of Baldr, the beloved god.

Her maternal love drove her to protect Baldr by making all creation swear an oath, a desperate attempt that was thwarted by Loki's cunning.",
  "collectible_card_gui_title": "The Deadly Mistletoe",
  "collectible_card_gui_description": "The only plant capable of harming the god Baldr. Frigg, in her quest to protect her son, had made every element of nature swear never to harm him. However, she overlooked mistletoe, considering it too young and weak to pose a threat. Loki, the god of mischief, exploited this flaw. He crafted an arrow from mistletoe and gave it to H√∂d, Baldr's blind brother, who killed him unintentionally.",
  "collectible_card_thor_title": "Thor the Protector",
  "collectible_card_thor_description": "The god of thunder, son of Odin and J√∂rd (the Earth). A devoted protector of Asgard and humans (Midgard), he is known for his prodigious strength and unwavering courage. Armed with his hammer Mj√∂llnir, which always returns to his hand, his belt Megingjord that multiplies his strength tenfold, and his iron gloves J√°rngreipr, he relentlessly fights giants and monsters that threaten cosmic order.",
  "collectible_card_mjollnir_title": "Mj√∂llnir",
  "collectible_card_mjollnir_description": "Thor's legendary hammer, forged by the dwarfs Brokkr and Sindri. A symbol of both protection and destruction, it can control lightning and thunder. Mj√∂llnir never misses its target and always returns to its bearer after being thrown. It is one of the most powerful weapons of the gods, indispensable in the eternal struggle against forces of chaos, especially giants.",
  "collectible_card_thrym_title": "Thrym the Giant",
  "collectible_card_thrym_description": "The formidable king of the frost giants (J√∂tun) who dared to steal Mj√∂llnir, Thor's hammer. In exchange for its return, he demanded the hand of the goddess Freyja. To retrieve his weapon, Thor disguised himself as Freyja, accompanied by Loki as a servant. The ruse worked, and once the hammer was in his possession, Thor slaughtered Thrym and his entire court, restoring the gods' honor.",
  "collectible_card_fenrir_title": "Fenrir the Wolf",
  "collectible_card_fenrir_description": "The gigantic wolf, one of the three monstrous children of Loki and the giantess Angrboda. The gods, frightened by his rapid growth and prophecies announcing he would cause their doom, decided to chain him. After breaking two chains, he was finally bound by the magical bond Gleipnir. During Ragnar√∂k, he will break free and fulfill his destiny by devouring Odin, before being killed by Vidar, Odin's son.",
  "collectible_card_tyr_title": "T√Ωr the Sacrificed",
  "collectible_card_tyr_description": "The god of war, law, and justice. Of exemplary courage, he is the only god who dared approach the wolf Fenrir when it became too large and threatening. To prove to the wolf that they didn't want to trap him with the magical chain Gleipnir, T√Ωr placed his right hand in the beast's mouth. When Fenrir realized he was chained, he tore off the hand. This sacrifice neutralized the wolf until Ragnar√∂k.",
  "collectible_card_gleipnir_title": "Gleipnir",
  "collectible_card_gleipnir_description": "The magical chain forged by the dwarfs to bind the wolf Fenrir. Unlike the heavy previous chains that Fenrir had broken, Gleipnir was as fine and supple as a silk ribbon. It was made from six impossible ingredients: the sound of a cat's footstep, a woman's beard, the roots of a mountain, a bear's sinews, a fish's breath, and a bird's saliva. It is the only bond that Fenrir could never break.",
  "collectible_card_ymir_title": "Ymir the Primordial Giant",
  "collectible_card_ymir_description": "The first living being, a primordial giant born from the meeting of fire from Muspelheim and ice from Niflheim in the void of Ginnungagap. From his sweat came the first giants. He was nourished by the cosmic cow Audhumla. Eventually, he was killed by the gods Odin and his brothers, Vili and V√©. From his body, they created the world: his flesh became the earth, his blood the oceans, his bones the mountains, and his skull the celestial vault.",
  "collectible_card_audhumla_title": "Audhumla the Cosmic Cow",
  "collectible_card_audhumla_description": "The primordial cow, born from melting ice at the beginning of time, just like the giant Ymir. From her udders flowed four rivers of milk that nourished Ymir and ensured his survival. By licking a salty block of ice, Audhumla revealed Buri, the first of the gods and Odin's ancestor. She is thus the origin of both lineages, that of giants and that of gods, who will clash during Ragnar√∂k.",
  "collectible_card_ginnungagap_title": "The Ginnungagap",
  "collectible_card_ginnungagap_description": "The gaping and silent void that existed before any creation. It was a bottomless abyss, bordered to the north by the icy realm of Niflheim and to the south by the fiery realm of Muspelheim. It was from the meeting between the icy breath of Niflheim and the burning sparks of Muspelheim at the center of Ginnungagap that life emerged, giving birth to the primordial giant Ymir and the cosmic cow Audhumla.",
  "collectible_card_brokkr_sindri_title": "Brokkr and Sindri",
  "collectible_card_brokkr_sindri_description": "Two dwarf brothers, master smiths renowned for their unmatched skill. Following a trick by Loki, they made a wager with the god that they could create more wonderful objects than those made by the sons of Ivaldi. They thus forged three exceptional treasures: the golden boar Gullinbursti for Freyr, the golden ring Draupnir for Odin, and the most famous of all, the hammer Mj√∂llnir for Thor, despite a minor flaw (its short handle) due to Loki's interference.",
  "collectible_card_draupnir_title": "Draupnir the Ring",
  "collectible_card_draupnir_description": "The magical ring of pure gold possessed by Odin, one of the greatest treasures of the gods. Forged by the dwarfs Brokkr and Sindri, its name means 'the dripper'. It has the extraordinary ability to multiply: every nine nights, it produces eight new gold rings of identical weight and quality. Draupnir was placed by Odin on his son Baldr's funeral pyre as a sign of respect, but was returned to him from the realm of the dead.",
  "collectible_card_gungnir_title": "Gungnir the Spear",
  "collectible_card_gungnir_description": "Odin's infallible spear, which never misses its target. Its name means 'the swaying one'. It was also forged by dwarfs, the sons of Ivaldi, and obtained by Loki. An oath carved on its tip guarantees its accuracy. Gungnir is a symbol of Odin's power and authority as god of war. It was by sacrificing himself, hanging from Yggdrasil and pierced by his own spear, that Odin acquired knowledge of the runes.",
  "collectible_card_hrimthurs_title": "Hrimthurs the Builder",
  "collectible_card_hrimthurs_description": "A giant (J√∂tunn) who presented himself to the gods as a simple builder. He proposed an audacious bargain: to build an impregnable fortress around Asgard in just three seasons. In payment, he demanded the goddess Freyja, as well as the Sun and Moon. The gods accepted, thinking the task impossible. But the giant, aided by his magical horse Svadilfari, progressed so quickly that the gods became frightened and asked Loki to intervene.",
  "collectible_card_svadilfari_title": "Svadilfari the Horse",
  "collectible_card_svadilfari_description": "The magical and exceptionally strong horse of the builder giant Hrimthurs. Its name means 'unlucky traveler'. Svadilfari's speed and power were such that it allowed its master to build Asgard's wall at prodigious speed, threatening to make the giant win the wager. To sabotage the work, Loki transformed into a beautiful mare and lured Svadilfari away from its master, thus preventing the wall's completion in time.",
  "collectible_card_sleipnir_title": "Sleipnir the Eight-Legged Horse",
  "collectible_card_sleipnir_description": "Odin's horse, born from the union of Loki transformed into a mare and Svadilfari. The fastest of all horses in the nine worlds, capable of galloping on land, sea, and air. Sleipnir is Odin's faithful steed, carrying him across worlds during his journeys. His eight legs symbolize his supernatural speed and his ability to move between dimensions.",
  "collectible_card_bifrost_title": "Bifrost",
  "collectible_card_bifrost_description": "The vibrant and shimmering rainbow bridge that connects Midgard, the world of men, to Asgard, the fortress of the gods. It is described as being made of fire, air, and water, and is stronger than any other structure. It is permanently guarded by the god Heimdall, who watches over its access from his guard post, Himinbj√∂rg. Bifrost will collapse during Ragnar√∂k under the weight of the fire giants led by Surt.",
  "collectible_card_bragi_title": "Bragi",
  "collectible_card_bragi_description": "The god of poetry, eloquence, and music. He is the husband of Idunn, keeper of the apples of youth. Bragi is depicted as a wise old man with a long beard, whose words are so beautiful they charm all who hear them. He is the skald (poet) of the gods' court in Asgard, welcoming valorous warriors arriving at Valhalla with his epic songs that recount their deeds and the glory of the gods.",
  "collectible_card_brisingamen_title": "Brisingamen",
  "collectible_card_brisingamen_description": "The magnificent and legendary necklace of the goddess Freyja. Its name means 'fire jewel'. It was forged by four expert dwarfs. To obtain it, Freyja had to spend one night with each of them. This necklace is the symbol of her beauty, seduction, and power over love and desire. It was stolen by Loki and recovered by Heimdall after a fierce battle where both took the form of seals.",
  "collectible_card_freyja_title": "Freyja",
  "collectible_card_freyja_description": "Major goddess of Norse mythology, associated with love, beauty, fertility, but also war, wealth, and magic (seidr). Twin sister of Freyr, she is the most beautiful of goddesses. She rules over her own realm, F√≥lkvangr, where she welcomes half the warriors who died heroically in battle, the other half going to Odin's Valhalla. She possesses the necklace Brisingamen and a chariot pulled by two cats.",
  "collectible_card_gjallarhorn_title": "Gjallarhorn",
  "collectible_card_gjallarhorn_description": "The 'Resounding Horn' of the god Heimdall. He uses it to watch over the Bifrost bridge. The sound of this horn is so powerful it can be heard in all nine worlds. Heimdall will sound the Gjallarhorn only once, but it will be for a momentous event: he will use it to alert all gods of the beginning of Ragnar√∂k, when giants and monsters launch their final assault against Asgard.",
  "collectible_card_heimdall_title": "Heimdall",
  "collectible_card_heimdall_description": "The vigilant guardian of Asgard, stationed at the entrance of the Bifrost bridge to prevent giants from invading the realm of the gods. Born of nine mothers, he possesses superhuman senses: his piercing sight allows him to see hundreds of leagues away and his hearing is so fine he can hear grass growing. He is the keeper of the horn Gjallarhorn. During Ragnar√∂k, he will be the last to fall, killing his eternal enemy Loki in a battle where they will kill each other.",
  "collectible_card_hel_title": "Hel",
  "collectible_card_hel_description": "Daughter of Loki and the giantess Angrboda, sister of the wolf Fenrir and the serpent J√∂rmungandr. Banished by Odin, she became the sovereign of the realm of the dead, Helheim. She is often depicted with a body half living and half decomposed. She rules over the souls of those who died of sickness or old age, as opposed to warriors who died in combat and go to Valhalla or F√≥lkvangr. Her power over the dead is absolute.",
  "collectible_card_helheim_title": "Helheim",
  "collectible_card_helheim_description": "The realm of the dead, one of the nine worlds, ruled by the goddess Hel. It is a dark, cold, and misty place, located in the depths of Niflheim. This is where the souls of those who did not die heroically in battle go. The entrance to Helheim is guarded by the monstrous dog Garm. Even the gods cannot escape without Hel's permission, as shown by the vain attempt to bring Baldr back to life.",
  "collectible_card_hofund_title": "Hofund",
  "collectible_card_hofund_description": "The gleaming sword of the guardian god Heimdall. Its name means 'man's head', possibly referring to a carved pommel. Like its owner, the sword is a symbol of vigilance and protection for Asgard. Though less famous than other divine weapons like Mj√∂llnir or Gungnir, Hofund is a powerful weapon that will be used by Heimdall in his final and mutually destructive battle against Loki during Ragnar√∂k.",
  "collectible_card_huginnmuninn_title": "Huginn and Muninn",
  "collectible_card_huginnmuninn_description": "The two ravens perched on Odin's shoulders. Their names mean 'Thought' (Huginn) and 'Memory' (Muninn). Each morning, Odin sends them to traverse the nine worlds. Upon their return, they whisper in his ear everything they have seen and heard. They are the All-Father's sources of information, granting him quasi-omniscient knowledge of past, present, and future events, and helping him in his insatiable quest for wisdom.",
  "collectible_card_idunn_title": "Idunn",
  "collectible_card_idunn_description": "Goddess of youth and eternity, wife of the poet god Bragi. She is the keeper of the golden apples, magical fruits that grant the gods their youth and immortality. Without these apples, the gods would age and die like mere mortals.

  "collectible_card_jormungandr_description": "The Serpent of Midgard, one of the three children of Loki and the giantess Angrboda. Thrown into the ocean surrounding Midgard by Odin, it grew so enormously that it ended up encircling the world of men and biting its own tail, hence its nickname 'World-Serpent'. It is Thor's sworn enemy. During Ragnar√∂k, the two adversaries will clash in a titanic battle. Thor will kill J√∂rmungandr but will succumb to its venom nine steps later.",

  "collectible_card_loki_description": "God of cunning, discord, and metamorphosis. Son of giants but admitted among the √Üsir gods, he is Odin's blood brother. Intelligent and charming, he uses his talents to help the gods escape difficult situations, but his mischievous and chaotic nature also drives him to be the source of most of their problems. Father of monsters like Fenrir, J√∂rmungandr, and Hel, his role becomes increasingly dark, ultimately triggering Ragnar√∂k.",

  "collectible_card_njord_description": "God of the sea, wind, fishing, and wealth. He belongs to the Vanir family of gods, but came to live in Asgard with his children, Freyja and Freyr, as a hostage after the war between the √Üsir and Vanir.

His unhappy marriage to the giantess Skadi, who loved the mountains while he loved the sea, illustrates the opposition between these two worlds.",

Daughter of the giant Thjazi, she went to Asgard to avenge her father's death, killed by the gods.

  "story_creation_of_the_world_card_1_detailed_story": "At the dawn of time, before any world, sea, sky, or land existed, there was only Ginnungagap‚Äîthe yawning void, the primordial abyss stretching into infinite solitude.\n\nIt was neither light nor darkness, neither hot nor cold, but absolute nothingness, where nothing could be born or die, for nothing yet existed. This colossal emptiness separated two realms of opposite nature, like two antagonistic forces awaiting their cosmic confrontation.\n\nTo the north of Ginnungagap lay Niflheim, the world of eternal ice and mist, from which flowed the eleven rivers of √âliv√°gar, carrying waters so cold they froze instantly in the void. To the south burned Muspellheim, the realm of eternal and unquenchable fire, guarded by the giant Surtr, who wielded his flaming sword as he awaited the day he would set all worlds ablaze.\n\nThus the primordial forces faced each other across the vastness of the void, preparing creation through their very opposition.",

  "story_creation_of_the_world_card_2_description": "When the blazing sparks of Muspellheim met the icy mists of Niflheim, the ice melted into torrents of primordial water, giving birth to the essence of life.",
  "story_creation_of_the_world_card_2_detailed_story": "For countless eons, fire and ice remained separated by the vastness of Ginnungagap. But slowly, inexorably, the fiery sparks of Muspellheim began to drift northward, carried by imperceptible cosmic winds.\n\nWhen these sparks of pure heat met the icy mists of Niflheim in the heart of the void, an extraordinary phenomenon occurred. For the first time since the beginning of time, the ice began to melt, releasing torrents of primordial water.\n\nThese drops of water, born from the miraculous union of opposites, fell into the abyss of Ginnungagap. There, infused with the vital force born from this impossible union of fire and ice, they began to stir with creative energy.\n\nIt was the first miracle of existence: from the opposition of contrary forces emerged the very possibility of life. The primordial water carried within it the seed of all that was to come.",
  "story_creation_of_the_world_card_3_title": "The Birth of Ymir and Audhumla",
  "story_creation_of_the_world_card_3_description": "From these waters emerged Ymir, the first giant‚Äîcolossal and chaotic‚Äîaccompanied by Audhumla, the nourishing cow. Together, they paved the way for the gods and the lineages to come.",
  "story_creation_of_the_world_card_3_detailed_story": "From the primordial water, a colossal being arose: Ymir, the first giant, also known as Aurgelmir. His flesh was made of melted ice, his bones of ancient rock, and his eyes shone with a cold light like the newborn stars.\n\nBeside him appeared an immense cow named Audhumla, sustained by the sweet drops of water that had formed in Ginnungagap. Audhumla was the source of life for Ymir, providing the milk necessary for his survival. As she licked the ice of the mountains, she soon uncovered Buri, the first god, whose descendants would give rise to the Aesir.\n\nThus began the first generation of giants and gods, marking the dawn of the world‚Äôs history. Ymir became the father of the giants, while Audhumla nourished the beings who would shape the universe.",

  "story_creation_of_the_world_card_4_detailed_story": "The gods, aware that Ymir posed a threat to the balance of the cosmos, decided to end his chaotic reign. Odin, Vili, and V√©, the three divine brothers, joined forces to confront the primordial giant.\n\nIn an epic battle, they managed to slay Ymir. His colossal body collapsed into Ginnungagap, and his blood began to flow in torrents. This blood flooded nearly all the other giants, drowning them in an ocean of chaos.\n\nBut the gods did not stop at killing Ymir. They used his body to shape the world: his flesh became the earth, his bones the mountains, his blood the seas and rivers, and his skull the sky. Thus, from the death of the giant was born the universe as we know it.",
  "story_creation_of_the_world_card_5_title": "The Creation of the World",
  "story_creation_of_the_world_card_5_description": "From Ymir‚Äôs body, the gods forged the universe: the earth from his flesh, the mountains from his bones, the seas from his blood, and the sky from his skull, giving form to the world of men‚ÄîMidgard.",
  "story_creation_of_the_world_card_5_detailed_story": "After defeating Ymir, the gods set to work shaping the world from his colossal body. They began by dividing it into two equal halves, thus creating the earth and the sky.\n\nYmir‚Äôs flesh became fertile land, covered in lush forests and green plains. His bones were broken and raised into majestic mountains, forming the ranges that span the world. His blood, which had flooded the giants, was channeled to form deep seas and winding rivers.\n\nYmir‚Äôs skull was lifted to create the sky, supported by four dwarves representing the cardinal points: North, South, East, and West. The stars were placed in the sky as glittering lanterns, while the moon and sun were created to govern time.\n\nThus was born Midgard, the world of men, at the center of the universe, surrounded by the nine interconnected realms. The gods had shaped a harmonious cosmos from primordial chaos.",

  "story_war_of_aesir_and_vanir_card_1_detailed_story": "In the great hall of the gods of the sky, the torch flames cast wavering shadows on the walls, as if listening to the whispers of the immortals. The Vanir, masters of fields and harvests, had introduced a new kind of magic‚Äîborn of earth and seasons‚Äîthat fascinated as much as it frightened. The Aesir, warriors of Asgard, viewed this power with suspicion: this foreign knowledge threatened their authority. Among them, some saw opportunity, others danger. Words turned to accusations, and accusations into barely contained fury. The silence between speeches was no longer one of respect, but the stillness before a storm. Greed mixed with fear, pride with envy. The wind beating against the hall‚Äôs doors seemed itself to foretell a rupture. When gazes grew too heavy and hands clenched on armrests, all understood that the thread binding these two clans was about to snap. The fragile balance of the world was already tilting toward chaos.",

  "story_war_of_aesir_and_vanir_card_2_detailed_story": "Tension found its form in a woman from the Vanir‚Äîa messenger and mistress of the arcane powers of fertility. Her radiant beauty and mysterious knowledge disturbed the established order. The Aesir, unable to tolerate such independence, sought to silence her with fire. But three times the flames consumed her body, and three times she was reborn, stronger and more resplendent, as if the earth itself refused to surrender her to the flames. This act revealed the abyss separating the two peoples. The Vanir, outraged by this sacrilege, rose in arms, calling upon the winds and harvests for aid. The Aesir, wounded in pride, seized their spears and prepared for battle. The war did not begin with a cry, but with a fateful silence, when all knew there was no turning back. The first blood soon flowed, and with it shattered the illusion of lasting peace. From then on, the air was heavy with ashes and curses.",

  "story_war_of_aesir_and_vanir_card_3_detailed_story": "Thus began a war no mortal mind could have conceived. The Aesir struck with the fury of thunder, their weapons forged in the fires of eternal forges. The Vanir retaliated by invoking the fertility of the land, turning fields into living traps, summoning torrents and forests where once there was desolation. Each battle tore the world apart, each victory quickly turned to defeat. The walls of Asgard trembled, and the plains of the Vanir burned to ash. Neither side retreated, and yet neither advanced. The endless war became a wound that would not heal. The songs of the skalds no longer celebrated triumphs but spoke only of endless ruin. Winds carried the smoke of burning lands into the mortal realms, and even Yggdrasil, the cosmic tree, seemed to groan under the weight of this discord. In the eyes of the gods there was no longer pride, but the weariness of a futile struggle. And still, none would yield first.",

  "story_war_of_aesir_and_vanir_card_4_detailed_story": "When too much blood had been spilled, when weapons grew as heavy as hearts, an idea emerged from the ruins of battle. The two clans, unable to defeat one another, resolved to attempt an act of trust: the exchange of hostages. The Vanir sent two of their wisest‚Äîa brother and sister whose beauty and power surpassed even that of fields and rivers. The Aesir, in turn, offered a master of runes, keeper of ancient secrets, and another god with a sharp tongue. The exchange was sealed not in joy but in suspicion, every step burdened by doubt. The hostages crossed enemy plains and fortresses, carrying with them the fragile hopes of an uncertain peace. The air was taut as a drawn bowstring, and every glance cast upon them might at any moment turn into a threat. Yet through this act of caution, a delicate balance began to return. For the first time in ages, the gods raised not their weapons, but their oaths.",

  "story_war_of_aesir_and_vanir_card_5_detailed_story": "Time did its work, and slowly, the hostages became more than guarantors‚Äîthey became bridges. The Vanir, welcomed among the Aesir, taught the magic of the earth, revealing the secrets of harvest and season. The Aesir, in return, shared the discipline of their runes, the courage of battle, and the order of their laws. Grudges did not vanish in an instant, but through years of patience and shared trials, bonds were woven. The children of these divine unions carried within them both legacies‚Äîthe thunder‚Äôs might and the earth‚Äôs fertility. Feasts replaced battles, and songs once again celebrated the strength of unity rather than the desolation of war. Yet in every gaze lingered a shadow: the memory of war, like a scar that time could not erase. Still, for a while, peace reigned‚Äîfragile, but real.",

  "story_war_of_aesir_and_vanir_card_6_detailed_story": "The end of the war was not a victory, but a mutual recognition. The Aesir understood they could not rule alone over sky and battle, and the Vanir accepted that earth and fertility must join with strength and law. A new era began, where the two clans‚Äîlong enemies‚Äîsat side by side in the halls of Asgard. The oaths they swore rang like stones laid in a riverbed: solid, yet subject to the current of fate. The gods knew trials would come, that chaos had not vanished, but they understood that only unity could grant survival when the twilight to come arrived. Thus, from the ashes of discord was born the alliance. The skalds then sang not of victory‚Äôs glory, but of the wisdom of compromise, and their songs echoed even in the mortal realms. The Vanir and Aesir became one divine people, bound not by blood spilled, but by blood shared.",

  "story_mead_of_poetry_card_1_detailed_story": "When the fragile peace between the Aesir and the Vanir was sealed, the gods mingled their spittle, and from this pact was born Kvasir, a being of pure knowledge. Kvasir roamed the worlds, answering the questions of gods and men; his speech was insight, his breath a song. But greed stirred in the hearts of two dwarves, Fjalar and Galar, thirsty for power. Through deceit they lured Kvasir into a cavern, killed him, and gathered his blood. In massive cauldrons they mixed this blood with the purest honey and cast their runes as one sows seeds. The liquid took on a golden hue, shimmering with a gleam that seemed to contain verses and prophecies. The dwarves soon realized this was no mere drink‚Äîit was the source of poetry, the sap of words and wisdom. They named the vessels √ì√∞rerir, Bo√∞n, and S√≥n, and guarded their treasure jealously, unaware that this theft would spark envy and tragedy among giants and gods alike. Thus was born, from violence and treachery, the very essence of inspiration.",

  "story_mead_of_poetry_card_2_detailed_story": "When the treachery of the dwarves and the theft of Kvasir‚Äôs essence were revealed, wrath burst forth. The victim‚Äôs kin, outraged, demanded justice. Cornered, Fjalar and Galar offered their treasure as ransom‚Äîthe drink of verse and vision. The giant Suttungr, a being of vast stature and appetite for marvels, accepted without hesitation. He carried the three cauldrons into the mountain of Hnitbj√∂rg, carving a chamber so deep that even light seemed reluctant to descend. There, among stalactites like stone fangs, he engraved sealing runes and wove defenses and enchantments around them. To guard the gift that granted wisdom, he entrusted his daughter Gunnl√∂√∞‚Äîsweet and fierce, with eyes the color of honey. Gunnl√∂√∞ spent her days and nights singing to her ward and sometimes tasting the scent that lingered: the mead radiated a living aura. Waves of desire and loneliness tightened her heart; she became the living key of a treasure that was both promise and curse. Thus the nectar of words slept, watched over by filial love and a giant‚Äôs pride.",

  "story_mead_of_poetry_card_3_detailed_story": "Great Odin, ever thirsty for knowledge and power, learned of the mead‚Äôs hiding place and desired nothing more than to taste it. Under the guise of B√∂lverk‚Äîan alias and mask of toil‚Äîhe came to Baugi, Suttungr‚Äôs brother, and offered his labor. With wise words and patient gestures, he gained the giant‚Äôs trust. Flattered, Baugi agreed to use a magic auger named Rati to bore through the rock. The tool screeched and the stone cracked; the song of iron on stone echoed like a prophecy. When air finally passed through, Odin slipped into the opening‚Äînot with strength, but with cunning: he transformed into a serpent and slithered through the crevice, brushing against the warm stone. Inside, the glow of the cauldrons gleamed like the dawn of a new world. He knew wisdom would not yield without a price, and that he must deceive love and duty alike to seize the nectar of the gods. Yet no act was too base for him when the prize was immortal speech.",

  "story_mead_of_poetry_card_4_description": "Odin charms Gunnl√∂√∞ and wins the right to taste the mead three times, altering the destiny of the treasure.",
  "story_mead_of_poetry_card_4_detailed_story": "In the golden twilight of the cavern, Odin met Gunnl√∂√∞. The giant‚Äôs daughter, both fierce and tender, lived in rhythm with the cauldrons: she listened to the mead‚Äôs murmur as others might to prayers. Odin spoke not with the tone of a ruler, but as a wanderer who knows how to listen. He told her of the solitude of the heavens, the burden of wisdom, and the beauty of verse. Moved by his words and his unexpected gentleness, Gunnl√∂√∞ offered him three nights of hospitality. At each dawn, she let him drink from the cup; and on the third night, the god‚Äîmaster of guile‚Äîdrank the entire cauldron, then the next, then the last. The nectar set his spirit aflame: he saw the songs yet to be sung, the words that would make worlds tremble. Gunnl√∂√∞, betrayed, watched her treasure vanish, borne away by the silhouette of a sacred bird. Her sorrow mingled with shame, but fate had already turned: poetry had changed masters forever.",

  "story_mead_of_poetry_card_5_detailed_story": "As soon as the cauldrons were emptied, Odin transformed‚Äîwings and feathers burst from his back, and he took the form of a mighty bird of prey, his dark silhouette framed by the cave‚Äôs glow. He leapt from the mountain, the mead dripping in golden drops from his beak, tracing streaks of light through the rain. Hearing his daughter‚Äôs cries, Suttungr too took the shape of a monstrous eagle and soared in pursuit. The two beings tore through the clouds; lightning laced their flight, and the heavens roared like a forge. Their wings beat the air like storm-tossed sails, and the distance between wisdom and wrath was measured in heartbeats. Below, the lands saw two colossal shadows‚Äîone bearing the gods‚Äô gift, the other the rage of a bereaved father. Odin‚Äôs flight became an epic that held the world suspended between awe and terror.",

  "story_mead_of_poetry_card_6_detailed_story": "At last reaching the threshold of Asgard, the bird alighted in the great hall of the gods and resumed his divine form: Odin, bearer of a burning knowledge and a stolen secret. He spat the mead into golden cups; the gods drank, and poetry resonated within their souls. The halls filled with new songs, unexpected inspirations, and constellations of words woven like webs. Yet in his flight‚Äôs haste, a few golden drops had fallen to the earth below. Those pearls of fate touched mortal lips: some turned them into verses that defied the gods, while others gained only delusion or madness.

The serpent of the depths emerged, spewing torrents of foam and fury. The boat threatened to splinter under the beast‚Äôs weight. Thor, his feet braced on the soaked wood, gripped the rope as if he meant to hold back the sea itself. Hymir, frozen with terror, shrank away, his wide eyes fixed on the gaping maw that could swallow mountains and fortresses whole. The enraged serpent thrashed, its coils striking the waves into tempests. Each passing second seemed to suspend time itself ‚Äî balanced between victory and catastrophe ‚Äî while thunder and lightning illuminated their titanic struggle.",

But before he could deliver the blow, a scream of terror rose behind him. Hymir, seized by panic, had grabbed the rope and, in a desperate act, severed it. The serpent, freed from its bond, disappeared into the depths with a roar that made the entire ocean quake.\n\nThe boat capsized from the shock, hurling Thor and Hymir into the freezing waters. The thunder god surfaced, gasping, his hair plastered to his face by the salt. Hymir, trembling with cold and fear, clung to a drifting plank. Silence fell over the sea, broken only by the gentle slap of waves and the ragged breaths of the two survivors.\n\nThor gazed toward the horizon, his heart heavy. He had not slain the serpent of the depths, but he had survived a trial that would have broken any other being. The fate of the gods remained uncertain, but one thing was clear ‚Äî the struggle against the forces of chaos had only just begun.",

Among them, none was more beloved than Baldr, the radiant son of Odin and Frigg. He was light incarnate, flawless beauty made divine, a god so pure that even the darkest beings held him in reverence. Wherever he walked, peace followed, laughter blossomed, and hearts were warmed.\n\nBut one day, that brightness began to fade. Night after night, Baldr was consumed by dark dreams‚Äîvisions terrifying and clear as prophecy. He saw himself perish, pierced by an unknown weapon, and the echoes of his death reverberated through the roots of Yggdrasil. The nightmares clung to him, and he recounted them to the others, pale-faced and shaken to his core.\n\nThe gods did not laugh. For Baldr‚Äôs dreams were no mere illusions. They carried within them the raw truth of what was to come. A chill swept through the golden halls of the Aesir, for if Baldr were to die‚Ä¶ then it would be the world itself that began to fall into darkness.",

Her love for Baldr was infinite, and the mere thought of his death was a torment worse than a thousand deaths of her own. Driven by anguish and resolve, she set out on a sacred journey.\n\nThrough the frozen winds of Niflheim, the blazing lands of Muspellheim, the deep forests of Alfheim, and down to the shadowed depths of Helheim, she sought oaths from every living and lifeless thing. From the stones, that they would not strike her son. From the waters, that they would not drown him. From the fire, that it would not burn him. From the beasts, that they would never attack him. From every plant, every metal, every element, she drew sacred promises never to harm Baldr.\n\nWhen her task was done, Asgard breathed once more in peace. Nothing, it seemed, could harm the beloved god. Yet in her haste, Frigg deemed one humble and discreet plant too trivial to matter‚Äîa small sprig of mistletoe hanging from the branches of old oaks. Too young, too frail, she thought. It could harm no one.\n\nAnd so, she passed it by.",

He spoke softly, asking the right questions at just the right time, with that disarming tenderness that so often masked his deceit.\n\n‚ÄúHave all things in the world sworn to protect Baldr?‚Äù he asked, his voice trembling with false frailty.\n\n‚ÄúAll,‚Äù Frigg replied with a weary smile. ‚ÄúAll‚Ä¶ except perhaps one. A small shoot of mistletoe hanging from the trees west of Valhalla. It is so tender, so young, so harmless...‚Äù\n\nThat was all Loki needed. He thanked her, bowed deeply, and vanished into the shadows. His steps led him straight to the sacred oaks, where the mistletoe swayed gently in the autumn wind. With calculated precision, he plucked it, feeling within it the key to a destiny he would soon unravel. For even the frailest of things, in the hands of malice, can become a deadly weapon.",

Upon the great plains of the palace, the gods gathered to amuse themselves with a strange pastime: they hurled weapons, stones, and spears at Baldr, who stood unflinching, untouched by any harm. For nothing, they believed, could ever wound him again.\n\nThen Loki approached H√∂d, Baldr‚Äôs blind brother, who stood apart, silent and alone.\n\n‚ÄúWhy do you not join the game, noble H√∂d?‚Äù Loki whispered gently. ‚ÄúYour brother deserves your tribute as well.

He settled in a remote valley, building a strange cabin with four doors facing each horizon, ever watchful for danger.
